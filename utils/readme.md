# What is?

Tools that where moved away from the spacewalk-utils-extras package. That package had community support only. For that reason we moved most of tools toa supports scenario (spacewalk-utils) or to this project.

# How to install each tool?

Copy the tool file to inside the container into the directory `/root/bin`.
This will make the tool available inside the container and the files will be persistent.
